# Data-analysis-of-AR-BNB-project
This dataset contains property listings with mixed data types: IDs (n), property names (text), host details (ID/verification status), location (latitude/longitude/borough), pricing (rates, minimum nights), reviews (scores/counts/dates), and house rules (text with many NaN values). Ideal for analysis of pricing, location trends, host reliability.
